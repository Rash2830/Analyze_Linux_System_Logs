Linux Log Basics
Understanding Linux Logs

Linux logs are critical system event records that capture detailed information about system activities, software performance, and potential issues. These log files serve as essential diagnostic tools for system administrators and developers to monitor, troubleshoot, and maintain Linux systems.
Log File Locations and Types

Linux systems typically store log files in the /var/log directory. Different log files capture various system events:
Log File 	Purpose
/var/log/syslog 	General system activities
/var/log/auth.log 	Authentication and security events
/var/log/kern.log 	Linux kernel messages
/var/log/messages 	System-wide message logs

Log Analysis
Practical Log Exploration Example

Here's a bash script demonstrating basic log file inspection:

#!/bin/bash

## Display last 10 system log entries
echo "Recent System Logs:"
tail -n 10 /var/log/syslog

## Count total log entries
echo "Total Log Entries:"
wc -l /var/log/syslog

## Filter specific log events
echo "SSH Authentication Attempts:"
grep "sshd" /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted" | tail -n 5

This script showcases fundamental log file interactions, helping users understand how to retrieve and analyze system events efficiently.
Syslog Configuration

Linux uses syslog daemon to manage log generation and routing. Configuration files like /etc/rsyslog.conf define log handling rules, enabling systematic log management across different system components.
Grep for Log Search
Introduction to Grep Command

Grep is a powerful text searching and filtering utility in Linux, essential for efficient log analysis and error detection. It allows precise pattern matching across log files, enabling quick identification of specific system events and troubleshooting.
Basic Grep Syntax and Patterns

Grep Command
Pattern Matching
Log File Filtering

Result Output
Grep Option 	Function
-i 	Case-insensitive search
-n 	Display line numbers
-v 	Invert match
-r 	Recursive search
-c 	Count matching lines
Practical Log Searching Examples

#!/bin/bash

## Search SSH authentication logs
grep "sshd" /var/log/auth.log

## Find error messages
grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog

## Count failed login attempts
grep -c "Failed" /var/log/auth.log

## Search multiple log files recursively
grep -r "critical" /var/log/

Advanced Grep Techniques

Complex log searching often requires combining grep with other commands:

## Pipe-based log filtering
journalctl | grep "systemd" | grep -v "debug"

## Extract specific log sections
grep -A 5 -B 2 "error" /var/log/kern.log

These examples demonstrate versatile log searching strategies using grep, enabling comprehensive system event analysis.
Real coding. Zero setup. Maximum fun.

Performance and Security Log Analysis

#!/bin/bash

## Identify top CPU consuming processes
ps aux | awk '{print $2, $3, $11}' | sort -k2 -nr | head -n 10

## Extract unique IP addresses from authentication logs
grep "Failed" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

## Monitor real-time system resource usage
journalctl -f -u system.slice

Security Log Parsing Script

#!/bin/bash

## Detect potential brute-force SSH attacks
failed_attempts=$(grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1 > 5')

if [ -n "$failed_attempts" ]; then
  echo "Potential SSH Brute Force Detected:"
  echo "$failed_attempts"
fi
